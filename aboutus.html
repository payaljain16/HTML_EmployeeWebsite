<p>The company is the flagship company of the Lohia Group and a global supplier of machinery for end-to-end solutions for plastic woven fabric industry used for packaging systems for solid bulk materials and infrastructure applications.</p>

<p>The company was incorporated in 1981 as a joint venture with Starlinger & Co. GmbH of Austria for manufacturing of Circular Looms. It has changed its name to Payal Limited in March 2013, consequent to the exit of Starlinger as shareholder.</p>

<p>We since inception set a vision for the company to be an end-to-end supplier of the machinery & solution for the plastic woven industry. Accordingly, after fully absorbing the know-how for the Circular Looms, we expanded our portfolio in 1984 by adding tape extrusion line & winders in our production program. Continuous investments in upgrading the in-house manufacturing capabilities together with state-of-the-art research & development facility and commitment to build world-class knowledge base assisted by qualified technicians, engineers and managers led not only to up-gradation of weaving, extrusion & winding technologies but we also added products like lamination & coating, conversion and PP multifilament extrusion lines. Today, we have full range of machinery in each of the technology vertical to cover almost the complete range of end use application of the plastic woven fabric.</p>

<p>We in company believe that good quality products need equally good pre & post sale technical support services including prompt supply of spare parts for the customer to realize the benefits of the technology over the complete life cycle of the machinery. We have invested in systems and capabilities of our human resource assets to service our worldwide customers on time and efficiently. We have our offices in strategically important markets equipped with sales & servicing support including spare part warehouses and are networked through capable & committed sales agents to remain close to our customers.</p>

<p>We have delivered till date accumulated plastic processing capacity of 3 million tons with installation base of more than 1,350 extrusion lines & 56,000 Circular Looms in over 80 countries producing almost full range of plastic woven fabrics & packaging solutions for our worldwide customers.</p>

<p>Payal Netbanking Services Ltd. is committed to follow the best business practices with the highest standards of ethics in serving the industry globally. The company is strategically prepared to unlock its immense potential for growth by setting new industry standards.</p>
